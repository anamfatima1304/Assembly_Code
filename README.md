# Assembly Codes

This repository is designed for programmers who are new to the world of assembly language. Here, you'll find a collection of exercises and examples to help you get started writing code that directly interacts with the hardware.

## Welcome to Beginner Assembly!

**What is Assembly Language?**

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that bridges the gap between human-readable instructions and the machine code understood by computers. It offers more control over the hardware compared to higher-level languages like Python or Java.

**What's in this Repository?**

This repository is structured with folders containing assembly code examples and exercises. Each folder will include:

* Assembly source files (`.asm` extension) containing the code you'll modify and practice with.
* Optional text files (`.txt` extension) with explanations and instructions for each exercise.

**Compiling and Running Assembly Code**

To run the assembly code you write, you'll need an assembler and a simulator or emulator. These tools translate your code into machine code and provide an environment to execute it. Here are some popular options:

* **NASM (Netwide Assembler):** A free and open-source assembler for various architectures.
* **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler):** A Windows-based assembler commonly used with x86 processors.
* **QEMU:** An emulator that can simulate different computer architectures.

In these exercise, I am using MASM. The MASM setup file is also available.

**Contributing**

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new exercises, explanations, or improvements to existing code.  

We encourage you to explore, experiment, and ask questions if you get stuck. There are many online communities dedicated to assembly language programming where you can find help and connect with other learners.

**Happy Coding!**
